The data I used for the analysis of routes is the Taxi Trajectory Data availaible on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/crailtap/taxi-trajectory).
I didn't include the data as it was too big (~ 2GB).

This folder has a jupyter notebook which is to be run on jupyter, and has analysis of the trips by a taxi, which can be used as an example to 
what a commercial car travel routes would look like and what can be conferred from it.

Please Install the required dependencies which are in first cell of imports to run the notebook successfully.

The analysis from the notebook can be used to generate ML models to recommend routes.
